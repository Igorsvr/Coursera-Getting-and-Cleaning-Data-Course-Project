Code Book

- The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
Necessary is to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- All the used variables are:

 x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test,
 x_data, y_data and subject_data,
 features, xDataSet_mean_std, activity_labels,
 oneDataSet and secData.txt.

- The R script and the code is in the file: run_analysis.R. 
- The second, independent tidy data set is created in the file secData.txt
